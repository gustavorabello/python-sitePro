  <h1> Ph.D.: </h1>
  <p> The topic of the doctorate is two-phase flow and heat transfer in
  microchannels. One of the major aspects of this thesis will be to
  extend the single phase code (developed during the masters studies)
  and implement two-phase and heat transfer bringing the surface tension
  effects into the code for elongated bubble flows, annular flows and
  bubbly flows (for both evaporating flows and perhaps also for some
  condensing flows). Both Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Arbitrary
  Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework will be used to achieve such a
  task. Another interesting aspect could be for an isolated bubble
  growing at a wall in a cross-flow in a microchannel with down stream
  coalescence of the train of departing bubbles. All these works are
  done in the Heat and Mass Transfer Laboratory (LTCM) at the Swiss
  Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL). </p>

  <p> The project consisted in numerical simulation of hydropower
  reservoirs filling. The Navier-Stokes's equations had been modeled to
  describe the behaviour of the interaction between the surrounded
  nature (nutrients, vegetation, chemical components) and the flow
  itself. The Finite Element Method had been used for the mathematical
  discretization using triangular (2D) and tetrahedral (3D) elements.
  The final result is the development of a powerful commercial software
  able to predict the natural variables found in a generic hydropower
  reservoirs filling. </p>

  <h1> M.Sc.: </h1>

  <p> I started my masters studies at the Federal University of Rio de
  Janeiro in the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department
  (COPPE). The period of two years is required to receive the Master's
  degree and during this period we must follow some courses and write a
  dissertation based on a specific work. We have chosen to follow three
  directions of courses: scientific computing, mathematics and fluid
  mechanics, all of them done in their respective departments. The aim
  of the masters thesis was to develop a Finite Element code, under the
  object-oriented paradigm, to simulate the flow field close to an
  electrochemical cell immerse in H2SO4 solution. The Navier-Stokes's
  equations were used to model the real system. We had used the
  Semi-Lagrangian approach to to solve the convective (non-linear) term
  problem, one of the most serious problems involved in such a
  simulation. The others terms namely pressure and viscous terms, were
  discretized by the Galerkin method. The final linear system Ax=b was
  treated by the LU projection method, thus decoupling velocity and
  pressure in two smaller systems.</p>

  <h1> B.Eng.: </h1>

  <p> I started my scientific career in the end of my graduation period
  at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. I had published some
  interesting papers to Brazilian congresses about experiments on
  turbulent flows. After these publications, on the beginning of 2005, I
  made my graduation project, entitled "Atmospheric Boundary Layer
  Simulation in Wild Tunnel" where we had analyzed experimentally the
  effects of fluid flow and its boundary layer over a tropical and dense
  forest. This project had been started after some issues of local
  measurement and thus the experimental simulation in wind tunnel was
  performed to understand the atmospheric conditions in the Amazon
  Rainforest. After this project I received the mechanical engineer
  diploma. </p>
