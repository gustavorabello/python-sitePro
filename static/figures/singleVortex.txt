Single Vortex

In this test case, the remeshing methodology is massively tested while the bubble is subjected to a single vortex field. The tetrahedral background mesh is colored by the magnitude of the vortex field velocity. The red color represents high velocity, while the blue one stands for low intensity. As can be seen, the volume and interface remeshing algorihtms keep the finite elements with excellent aspect ratio (height, width, area and volume), thus avoiding low quality elements such as silver and kite types. Additionally, the phase volumes are kept constant, showing that the used methodology is suitable for large deformations.
