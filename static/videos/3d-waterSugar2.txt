3D Air-Water-Sugar

Numerical simulation of 3-dimensional two-phase flow is performed to redict the rising of an air bubble in a initially stagnant water-sugar solution. At the leftmost frame, the interface between fluid is represented by a set of points, edges and triangular facets which are part of the tetrahedron domain mesh. The middle frame is a contour plot of the same interface and the rightmost one is a side view of the 3-dimensional domain. Due to the flow nature, the initially spherical shape deforms while in ascension, then later the air bubble converges to its final shape as show in this animation.
