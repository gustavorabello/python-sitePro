3D Air-Water

The rising of a single air bubble in a stagnant column of water has been simulated. The 3-dimensional two-phase flow phenomena can be numerically predicted. At the leftmost frame, the interface between fluid is represented by a set of points, edges and triangular facets which are part of the tetrahedron domain mesh. The middle frame is a contour plot of the same interface and the rightmost one is a side view of the 3-dimensional domain. Due to its properties, the flow field changes the initially spherical shape while the bubble rises, thus affecting all the surrounded fluid.
