A numerical model is proposed for solving the Navier-Stokes equations coupled, through the physical properties of the fluid, to the transport equation of chemical species and energy, to simulate the complex fluid flow and transport in hydropower plant reservoirs. The Finite Element Method is employed in the problem discretization using a tetrahedral mesh with MINI element. This type of element fulfills the LBB condition and assures the stability of the numerical procedure.
