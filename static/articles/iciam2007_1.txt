We describe the main features of a numerical simulator currently under development for studying water physico-chemical properties during the flooding of hydroelectric plants reservoirs. The work is sponsored by the brazilian Electric Energy National Agency ANEEL and conducted in a joint work of brazilian universities rearchers, with Furnas Centrais Eletricas e S. A., the leading brazilian power utility company. An overview of the simulator requirements and of the involved partners is given. The software modules and engineering solutions are briefly discussed, including the finite element based transport module. Some results, future steps and partnerships are presented and discussed.
